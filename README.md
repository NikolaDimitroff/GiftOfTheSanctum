Gift Of The Sanctum
================

An isometric real-time multilayer browser canvas game.
--------

Gift Of The Sanctum is a very dynamic battle arena for wizards. The goal of course is to be the last one standing in a constantly shrinking arena and win the unimaginable riches, kept in The Sanctum. The battle is based on rounds and in the end of each round you can choose to either upgrade your magic spells or keep the points for your final score.
